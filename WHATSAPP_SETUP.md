## How It Works

### Phone Number Format

- System converts to: `+254712345678`

### Notification Triggers

WhatsApp notifications are sent when:

1. **Vendor receives RFQ alert**
   - Triggered when: Hospital submits RFQ
   - Message includes: Product names, link to view RFQ

2. **Buyer receives quotation**
   - Triggered when: Vendor submits quotation
   - Message includes: Product name, vendor name, price, link to compare

3. **Vendor's quotation is chosen**
   - Triggered when: Hospital selects quotation
   - Message includes: Product name, buyer contact info (phone + email)

4. **Admin gets registration alert**
   - Triggered when: New user registers
   - Message includes: User name, role, email, link to admin panel

### User Control

Users can:
- Enable/disable WhatsApp notifications in [settings](link://settings/notifications)
- Enable/disable email notifications separately
- See what notifications they'll receive
- Update preferences anytime

## Testing

### Test the Flow:

## Troubleshooting

### Messages Not Sending

2. ‚úÖ User has phone number in profile
3. ‚úÖ User has enabled WhatsApp notifications
4. ‚úÖ Phone number is in correct format (+254...)
5. ‚úÖ Sandbox is active (for testing)

### Common Issues
